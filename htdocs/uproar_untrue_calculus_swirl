Welcome to the end of the last challenge! You are truly worthy of being recruited by Redshift. However, the entire organization is fake.

I'm randomFractal, the leader of Redshift, and a friend of mine is teaching a course on computer security. I helped him set up a fake criminal organization, so he can use this to train everyone in the course on hacking into computer systems.

Should you accept our invitation into Redshift, you will be "captured" by their "operatives", and your goal is to give them enough clues to force them on this scavenger-hunt of a challenge that helps them learn about computer security.

You might be thinking at this point: will Kevin actually go through this much effort, set up a Cicada 3301-like challenge, just to go full-on meta and pull off a cheap joke? Yes. Yes he would.

Anyway, here's your flag: ECS{D3J0HN_VU_1E5642D125D521B176F1145B95A75BB3}. Well done.
